TODO:
- When updating Order Details, make sure on multi-item orders to match the descriptions with the
    current entry item before copying the data.
- After spreadsheet is loaded, show the last (most recent entry) in Dan and Connie tab to make it
    easier to find the next page to load without having to look at the spreadsheet directly.
- Fix the issue of removing the OCR capability in the Tika jar for reading the PDF file. This
    is causing the processing to slow down.
- Add an option command to read a line from the PDF file and from the Clipboard.
- Add the following capabilities to ScriptParser: Use of TABLEs, ability to execute an equation
    (i.e. run the following as a command: PARAM1 = $PARAM2 + 3 * 200)

TESTING:
 - Create tests for verifying functionality by specifying test web clips and PDF files to run with
    certain debug messages enabled. Then capturing the debug output and comparing them to expected
    results.
