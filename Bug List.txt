TODO:
- When updating Order Details, make sure on multi-item orders to match the descriptions with the
    current entry item before copying the data.
- After spreadsheet is loaded, show the last (most recent entry) in Dan and Connie tab to make it
    easier to find the next page to load without having to look at the spreadsheet directly.
- Fix the issue of removing the OCR capability in the Tika jar for reading the PDF file. This
    is causing the processing to slow down.
- Add the following PROGRAM features:
    - allow setting Boolean param to the result of a Comparison
    - add command to search StrArray and IntArray for a value given a starting index (returns index or -1)
    - add a Fixed Point Parameter value (use Integer for mantissa, add an Integer value for decimal & one for # of digits)
    - cleanup error handling messages.
 - Create tests for verifying functionality by specifying test web clips and PDF files to run with
    certain debug messages enabled. Then capturing the debug output and comparing them to expected
    results.

TESTING PHASE:
 * modify RESPONSE to be a StrArray instead of a String to access each element
 * add the ability to use '+=' for a String param
 * add the ability to use an operation prior to the '=' in a Calculation
 * add functionality for the Array commands
 * add command to output text to the console
 * add commands to open, read, write, and close a file
 * add command to read a row of data from the Spreadsheet into a StrArray
 * add command to read a column of data from the Spreadsheet into a StrArray
 * add command to clear the contents of the RESPONSE array
 * add command to read the PDF file into a StrArray that is accessible
 * add command to read the clipboard into a StrArray that is accessible Clipboard.
