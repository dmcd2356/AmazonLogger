TODO:
- When updating Order Details, make sure on multi-item orders to match the descriptions with the
  current entry item before copying the data.

TESTING:
  - add ability to pass a file from the command line that specifies web page(s) that have been saved
    to files and/or a pdf file to read in. The test program may also pass a web page from the cilpboard
    to the program. When run this way, the user interface will not run and the debug log will be sent
    to the specified debug log output (or standard output if none is specified).

  - Create tests for verifying functionality by specifying test web clips and PDF files to run with
    certain debug messages enabled. Then capturing the debug output and comparing them to expected
    results.
