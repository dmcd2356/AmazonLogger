KNOWN BUGS:
 - BUG: adding rows to new tab created with -saddtab does not put any data in the tab, although the tab and name are created.
 - BUG: get rid of the OCR data that is output when it is run (not sure why this is occurring)
 - BUG: eliminate duplicate text data on OCR scan (not sure why this is occurring)

TODO:

FUTURE:
 - add a Fixed Point Parameter value (use Integer for mantissa, add an Integer value for decimal & one for # of digits)
