KNOWN BUGS:
 - BUG: adding rows to new tab created with -saddtab does not put any data in the tab, although the tab and name are created.
 - BUG: sometimes the description is not correct - there is a numeric value that it reads in place of it.
     (demonstrated when using file Sample_Your_Orders_Connie.txt as clipboard on Test-list.ods - it read a 2 as the description
      for item 111-9093528-3857063 because it thought the '?' was the rating, and took the next line ('2') as the description)
 - BUG: get rid of the OCR data that is output when it is run (not sure why this is occurring)
 - BUG: eliminate duplicate text data on OCR scan (not sure why this is occurring)

TODO:
 - cleanup error handling messages and reporting errors with the stack trace.
 - More thorough error checking
 - Create tests for verifying functionality by specifying test web clips and PDF files to run with
    certain debug messages enabled. Then capturing the debug output and comparing them to expected
    results.

FUTURE:
 - add -hyper option command to place a hypertext link in the cell of a spreadsheet
 - add a Fixed Point Parameter value (use Integer for mantissa, add an Integer value for decimal & one for # of digits)
 - When updating Order Details, make sure on multi-item orders to match the descriptions with the
    current entry item before copying the data.
 - After spreadsheet is loaded, show the last (most recent entry) in Dan and Connie tab to make it
    easier to find the next page to load without having to look at the spreadsheet directly.
 - add ability to read from port when running in background so commands can be sent from external program
    that sends commands to port. It could then allow stepping through the program and display current status.
