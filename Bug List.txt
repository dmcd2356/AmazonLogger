TODO:
- When updating Order Details, make sure on multi-item orders to match the descriptions with the
  current entry item before copying the data.
- Add command options to increase the column width and the max rows.
- Allow a spreadsheet to be loaded that has no header info, but don't allow any commands to run that
    require them (-c, -u, -p).
- Modify code to use sheetSel.getRow() to get the entire row of data when reading or writing a lot
    of data on the same row (the Parsers and PdfReader).
- Find a way to eliminate the need to rerun the AmazonReader for each command. Be able to pass a series
    of commands into the AmazonReader at one time so it runs much quicker.
- Determine why running -RGB followed by -cellput options on a command line does not update the text
    (but gives no error) and reversing the order by running -cellput followed by -RGB updates both
    color and text.

TESTING:
 - Create tests for verifying functionality by specifying test web clips and PDF files to run with
    certain debug messages enabled. Then capturing the debug output and comparing them to expected
    results.
