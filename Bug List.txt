TODO:
- When updating Order Details, make sure on multi-item orders to match the descriptions with the
  current entry item before copying the data.

TESTING:
  - make non-gui version run as a headless daemon, so commands don't have to keep specifying file names, tabs, etc.
  - Create tests for verifying functionality by specifying test web clips and PDF files to run with
    certain debug messages enabled. Then capturing the debug output and comparing them to expected
    results.
