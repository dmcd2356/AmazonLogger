KNOWN BUGS:
 - get rid of the OCR data that is output when it is run (not sure why this is occurring)
 - eliminate duplicate text data on OCR scan (not sure why this is occurring)

TODO:
 - add check to make sure a RETURN command is included in each subroutine, or have the ENDSUB do it.
 - add check to FOR loop commands to make sure the NEXT, CONTINUE, ENDFOR are all in same subroutine (or MAIN)
 - add capability to read params passed to subroutine ($0 for subroutine name, $1, $2, $3... for args passed)
 - cleanup ScriptExecute on checking parameters
 - cleanup error handling messages.
 - More thorough error checking
 - Create tests for verifying functionality by specifying test web clips and PDF files to run with
    certain debug messages enabled. Then capturing the debug output and comparing them to expected
    results.

POSSIBILITIES:
 - add -hyper option command to place a hypertext link in the cell of a spreadsheet
 - add DOUNTIL and DOWHILE commands (terminate in DONE)
 - add a Fixed Point Parameter value (use Integer for mantissa, add an Integer value for decimal & one for # of digits)
 - When updating Order Details, make sure on multi-item orders to match the descriptions with the
    current entry item before copying the data.
 - After spreadsheet is loaded, show the last (most recent entry) in Dan and Connie tab to make it
    easier to find the next page to load without having to look at the spreadsheet directly.

TESTING PHASE:
 * modify RESPONSE to be a StrArray instead of a String to access each element
 * add the ability to use '+=' for a String param
 * add the ability to use an operation prior to the '=' in a Calculation
 * add functionality for the Array commands
 * add command to output text to the console
 * add commands to open, read, write, and close a file
 * add command to read a row of data from the Spreadsheet into a StrArray
 * add command to read a column of data from the Spreadsheet into a StrArray
 * add command to clear the contents of the RESPONSE array
 * add command to read the PDF file into a StrArray that is accessible
 * add command to read the clipboard into a StrArray that is accessible Clipboard.
 * allow setting Boolean param to the result of a Comparison
 * Fix Boolean Comparison of String param to discreet String - the discreet value includes the quotes.
 * add WRITABLE, READABLE and DIRECTORY options to FEXISTS command for checking if file is readable or writable or is a directory
 * add DIRECTORY command for retrieving a list of dirs or files
 * add reserved response variables of $RANDOM, $TIME, $DATE
 * add .DAY and .MONTH String traits for $DATE and .DOW, .DOM, .DOY and .MOY Unsigned traits for $DATE
 * allow setting the RANDOM variable that sets the range of random values
 * add CD command to change directory within the Testpath base
 * add FILTER command and Trait to filter arrays.
 * Add ability to do OCR of scanned text documents and be able to read the text.
 * add ENDMAIN, SUB, ENDSUB, GOSUB, RETURN commands and $RETVAL return value from subroutine.
